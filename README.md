# Quiz App – Gamified Environmental Learning Platform 🌱

Quiz App is a gamified environmental education web application designed to make sustainability learning engaging, interactive, and action-oriented. The platform transforms traditional theoretical learning into a fun digital experience using quizzes, timers, progress tracking, and score-based evaluation.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon initiative under the Education & EdTech domain, focusing on environmental awareness and sustainable development.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Environmental education in many institutions is mostly theoretical. Students learn definitions, causes, and effects of environmental issues but lack interactive engagement and practical exposure. This results in low awareness of how daily habits such as waste disposal, energy usage, and transportation choices impact the environment.

There is a strong need for digital platforms that can:
- Make learning engaging and interactive  
- Motivate students through gamification  
- Encourage sustainable thinking and behavioral change  
- Track learning progress in a measurable way

## 💡 Solution Overview

Quiz App provides a simple yet effective gamified learning model where students:
- Log in using their name  
- Attempt environmental awareness quizzes  
- Answer time-bound questions  
- Track progress visually  
- Receive instant score-based feedback  

By combining education with engagement, the platform encourages learning through participation instead of memorization.
